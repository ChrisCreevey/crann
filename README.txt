A copy of the User manual is included with this distribution.

Three test datasets are also included with this distribution:
	lysozyme.txt   	(Primate lysozyme dataset)
	Carbonic.txt	(Carbonic anhydrase dataset)
	mhc.txt		(Primate Major Histocompatibility complex dataset)
		



The use of these datsets is described in:

Creevey, C.J. and McInerney J.O.: An algorithm for detecting directional and non-directional positive selection, neutrality and negative selection in protein coding DNA sequences. Gene 300(1-2):43-51.

The software is described in:

Creevey, C. and J. O. McInerney (2003). CRANN: Detecting adaptive evolution in protein-coding DNA sequences Bioinformatics 19: 1726.





To install, type at the command line:

cc evolve.c Li_Wu_19851993.c adaptive_tree.c "linked tree.c" -o crann -lm
