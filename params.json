It is important that the user understands the advantages and limitations of these methods. It is also important for the user to know that the software is designed to perform a number of different tasks, however the interpretation of the results is left entirely to the user.\r\n\r\nWe strongly advise that every user familiarises themselves with the Crann Manual and the original publications of the methods implemented in Crann.\r\n\r\n## References:\r\n\r\nCreevey, C. and J.
